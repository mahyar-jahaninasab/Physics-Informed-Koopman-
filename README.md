# Physics-Informed Koopman

This repository contains resources and datasets related to the spectral approximation of the Kuramoto model. Below are the contents and a brief description of each file and folder.

## Contents

### 1. Spectral_Approximation_kuramoto.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook performs the spectral approximation for the dataset.

### 2. IC
This folder contains the dataset for the initial conditions from different clusters. For each cluster, `M` different initial conditions were considered for the oscillators.

### 3. Train
This folder contains the dataset of the phase over time for the time step when the order parameter is equal to 0.9.

### 4. adj_mat
This folder collects different adjacency matrices.

### 5. Collection_data_for_kuramoto_model
This folder contains Python files for solving the Kuramoto model over time.
